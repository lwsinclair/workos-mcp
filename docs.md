Title: API Reference – WorkOS Docs

Events
------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/events)

Events represent activity that has occurred within WorkOS or within third-party identity and directory providers. They are used to keep your app in sync with WorkOS data. For more details on consuming events in your app, check out the [data syncing](https://workos.com/docs/events/data-syncing) guide.

Refer to the [Events](https://workos.com/docs/events) page for a full list of events that WorkOS emits.

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns ``object`

Organization
------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization)

An Organization is a top-level resource in WorkOS. Each Connection, Directory, and Audit Trail Event belongs to an Organization. An Organization will usually represent one of your customers.

### `organization`

Get a list of all of your existing organizations matching the criteria specified.

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns ``object`

Create an Organization
----------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization/create)

Creates a new organization in the current environment.

You can include one or more domains to associate with the organization, but you should [verify the ownership](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/domain-verification) of every domain before setting its state to `verified`.

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Update an Organization
----------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization/update)

Updates an organization in the current environment.

You can include one or more domains to associate with the organization, but you should [verify the ownership](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/domain-verification) of every domain before setting its state to `verified`.

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Delete an Organization
----------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization/delete)

Permanently deletes an organization in the current environment. It cannot be undone.

#### `Parameters`

Organization Domain
-------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization-domain)

An Organization Domain (also known as a User Email Domain) represents an [Organization](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization)’s domain.

These domains restrict which email addresses are able to sign in through SAML Connections when [allow profiles outside organization](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization) is `false`. This is the default behavior for Organizations. See [SSO frequently asked questions](https://workos.com/docs/sso/launch-checklist/frequently-asked-questions) for more details on this behavior.

Organization domains can be verified manually (through the API or the Dashboard), or through [a self-serve flow](https://workos.com/docs/domain-verification) through the Admin Portal. The organization that defines this domain policy exerts authentication policy control over that domain across your application. For this reason, it is important to verify ownership of manually added domains. Additionally, WorkOS does not allow addition of common consumer domains, like `gmail.com`.

Example Organization Domain

### `organization_domain`

List roles for an organization
------------------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/roles/list-for-organization)

User Management
---------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management)

A set of user authentication and organization security features designed to provide a fast, scalable integration while handling all of the user management complexity that comes with advanced business and customer needs.

To automatically respond to User Management activities, like authentication and changes related to the users, use the corresponding [events](https://workos.com/docs/events).

User
----

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/user)

Represents a user identity in your application. A user can sign up in your application directly with a method like password, or they can be [JIT-provisioned](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/jit-provisioning) through an organization’s SSO connection.

Users may belong to [organizations](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization) as members.

See the [events reference](https://workos.com/docs/events/user) documentation for the user events.

`DELETE`

### `/user_management/users/:id`

#### `Parameters`

Identities
----------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/identity)

Represents [User](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/user) identities obtained from external identity providers.

When a user authenticates using an external provider like [Google OAuth](https://workos.com/docs/integrations/google-oauth), information from that provider will be made available as one of the user’s Identities. You can read more about the process in our [identity linking guide](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/identity-linking).

Applications should check the `type` before making assumptions about the shape of the identity. Currently only `OAuth` identities are supported, but more types may be added in the future.

### `identity`

Get user identities
-------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/identity/list)

Get a list of identities associated with the user. A user can have multiple associated identities after going through [identity linking](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/identity-linking). Currently only OAuth identities are supported. More provider types may be added in the future.

`GET`

### `/user_management/users/:id/identities`

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Authentication
--------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/authentication)

Authenticate a user with a specified authentication method.

Get an authorization URL
------------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/authentication/get-authorization-url)

Generates an OAuth 2.0 authorization URL to authenticate a user with AuthKit or SSO.

`GET`

### `/user_management/authorize`

#### `Returns`

If you are using AuthKit, set the provider parameter to `"authkit"`, which will generate an authorization URL for your AuthKit domain. AuthKit will take care of detecting the user’s authentication method, such as identifying whether they use Email + Password or Single Sign-On,and direct them to the corresponding login flow.

Otherwise, to generate an authorization URL for a WorkOS SSO connection, you’ll have to specify the user’s connection, organization, or OAuth provider as a parameter. These connection selectors are mutually exclusive, and exactly one must be provided. The generated URL automatically directs the user to their identity provider. Once the user authenticates with their identity provider, WorkOS then issues a redirect to your redirect URI to complete the sign-in flow.

### Redirect URI

In the [OAuth 2.0](https://workos.com/docs/glossary/oauth-2-0) protocol, a redirect URI is the location that the user is redirected to once they have successfully authenticated with their identity provider.

When redirecting the user, WorkOS will generate an authorization code and pass it to your redirect URI as a `code` query parameter, your app will use this code to [authenticate the user](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/authentication/code). Additionally, WorkOS can pass a `state` parameter back to your application that you may use to encode arbitrary information to restore your application state between the redirects.

Redirect URI with query parameters

You can use `state` to encode parameters like originating URL and query parameters. This is useful in a flow where unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to a login page. After successful sign in, users will be routed to your redirect URI callback route. From there you can extract the originating URL from `state` and redirect the user to their intended destination.

You’ll need to configure the allowed redirect URIs for your application via the [Redirects](https://dashboard.workos.com/redirects) page in the dashboard. Without a valid redirect URI, your users will be unable to sign in. Make sure that the redirect URI you use as a parameter to get the authorization URL matches one of the redirect URIs you have configured in the dashboard.

Redirect URIs follow stricter requirements in production environments:

* `HTTPS` protocol is required in production environments

* `HTTP` and `localhost` are allowed in staging environments

* Wildcard characters are not allowed in production environments

Organization membership
-----------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/organization-membership)

An organization membership is a top-level resource that represents a [user](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/user)’s relationship with an [organization](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization). A user may be a member of zero, one, or many organizations.

See the [events reference](https://workos.com/docs/events/organization-membership) documentation for the organization membership events.

* Reactivating an `active` membership is a no-op and does not emit an event.

* Reactivating a `pending` membership returns an error. The user needs to [accept the invitation](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/invitations) instead.

See the [membership management documentation](https://workos.com/docs/user-management/users-organizations/organizations/membership-management) for additional details.

`PUT`

### `/user_management/organization_memberships/:id/reactivate`

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Invitation
----------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation)

An email invitation allows the recipient to sign up for your app and join a specific [organization](https://workos.com/docs/reference/organization). When an invitation is accepted, a [user](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/user) and a corresponding [organization membership](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/organization-membership) are created.

Users may be invited to your app without joining an organization, or they may be invited to join an organization if they already have an account. Invitations may be also issued on behalf of another user. In this case, the invitation email will mention the name of the user who invited the recipient.

Get an invitation
-----------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation/get)

Get the details of an existing invitation.

`GET`

### `/user_management/invitations/:id`

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

#### `Returns ``object`

Send an invitation
------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation/send)

Sends an invitation email to the recipient.

`POST`Sends email

### `/user_management/invitations`

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Accept an invitation
--------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation/accept)

Accepts an invitation and, if linked to an organization, activates the user’s membership in that organization.

In most cases, use existing authentication methods like [`authenticateWithCode`](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/authentication/code), which also accept an invitation token. These methods offer the same functionality (invitation acceptance and membership activation) while also signing the user in.

This method is useful for apps requiring a highly customized invitation flow, as it focuses solely on handling invitations without authentication. It’s also helpful when users can be invited to multiple organizations and need a way to accept invitations after signing in.

Your application should verify that the invitation is intended for the user accepting it. For example, by fetching the invitation using the [find-by-token endpoint](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation/find-by-token) and ensuring the email matches the email address of the accepting user.

`POST`

### `/user_management/invitations/:id/accept`

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Revoke an invitation
--------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/invitation/revoke)

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Get logout URL from session cookie
----------------------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/user-management/logout/get-logout-url-from-session-cookie)

Generates the logout URL by extracting the session ID from the session cookie. Use this over `getLogoutUrl` if you don’t have a saved reference to the session ID and you’d like the SDK to handle extracting the session ID from the cookie for you.

### `userManagement.getLogoutUrlFromSessionCookie()`

#### `Parameters ``object`

#### `Returns`

Single Sign-On
--------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso)

The Single Sign-On API has been modeled to meet the [OAuth 2.0](https://workos.com/docs/glossary/oauth-2-0) framework specification. As a result, authentication flows constructed using the Single Sign-On API replicate the OAuth 2.0 protocol flow.

To automatically respond to changes in your SSO connections, use the [Connection events](https://workos.com/docs/events/connection).

Get an authorization URL
------------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/get-authorization-url)

Generates an OAuth 2.0 authorization URL to authenticate a user with SSO.

#### `Returns`

You’ll have to specify the user’s connection, organization, or OAuth provider as a parameter. These connection selectors are mutually exclusive, and exactly one must be provided. The generated URL automatically directs the user to their identity provider. Once the user authenticates with their identity provider, WorkOS then issues a redirect to your redirect URI to complete the sign-in flow.

### Redirect URI

In the [OAuth 2.0](https://workos.com/docs/glossary/oauth-2-0) protocol, a redirect URI is the location that the user is redirected to once they have successfully authenticated with their identity provider.

When redirecting the user, WorkOS will generate an authorization code and pass it to your redirect URI as a `code` query parameter, your app will use this code to [get the user’s profile](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile/get-profile-and-token). Additionally, WorkOS can pass a `state` parameter back to your application that you may use to encode arbitrary information to restore your application state between the redirects.

Redirect URI with query parameters

You’ll need to configure the allowed redirect URIs for your application via the [Redirects](https://dashboard.workos.com/redirects) page in the dashboard. Without a valid redirect URI, your users will be unable to sign in. Make sure that the redirect URI you use as a parameter to get the authorization URL matches one of the redirect URIs you have configured in the dashboard.

Redirect URIs follow stricter requirements in production environments:

* `HTTPS` protocol is required in production environments

* `HTTP` and `localhost` are allowed in staging environments

* Wildcard characters are not allowed in production environments

### Error codes

If there is an issue generating an authorization URL, the API will return the original redirect URI with `error` and `error_description` query parameters. If provided, the `state` value will also be included.

Redirect URI with an error code

Possible error codes and the corresponding descriptions are listed below.

Profile
-------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile)

A Profile is an object that represents an authenticated user. The Profile object contains information relevant to a user in the form of normalized attributes.

After receiving the Profile for an authenticated user, use the Profile object attributes to persist relevant data to your application’s user model for the specific, authenticated user.

No Profile attributes can be returned other than the normalized attributes listed below.

### `profile`

Get a Profile and Token
-----------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile/get-profile-and-token)

Get an access token along with the user [Profile](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile) using the code passed to your [Redirect URI](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/get-authorization-url/redirect-uri).

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns ``object`

Get a User Profile
------------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile/get-user-profile)

Exchange an access token for a user’s [Profile](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile). Because this profile is returned in the [Get a Profile and Token endpoint](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/profile/get-profile-and-token) your application usually does not need to call this endpoint. It is available for any authentication flows that require an additional endpoint to retrieve a user’s profile.

#### `Parameters`

#### `Returns`

Connection
----------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/connection)

A connection represents the relationship between WorkOS and any collection of application users. This collection of application users may include personal or enterprise identity providers. As a layer of abstraction, a WorkOS connection rests between an application and its users, separating an application from the implementation details required by specific standards like [OAuth 2.0](https://workos.com/docs/glossary/oauth-2-0) and [SAML](https://workos.com/docs/glossary/saml).

See the [events reference](https://workos.com/docs/events/connection) documentation for the connection events.

#### `Parameters`

Directory Sync
--------------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/directory-sync)

Directory Sync allows you to connect with directory providers to inform your application of any changes in their users, groups, or access rules.

Using Directory Sync, one integration grants your application the ability to support multiple directory providers. Get real-time updates of any changes to the organization’s access rules, groups, and users by integrating webhooks into your application.

To automatically respond to changes in the connected directories and their users and groups, use the [Directory Sync events](https://workos.com/docs/events/directory-sync).

Directory
---------

[](https://workos.com/docs/reference/directory-sync/directory)

A directory stores information about an organization’s employee management system.

Synchronizing with a directory enables you to receive changes to an organization’s [user](https://workos.com/docs/reference/directory-sync/directory-user) and [group](https://workos.com/docs/reference/directory-sync/directory-group) structure.

Directory providers vary in implementation details and may require different sets of fields for integration, such as API keys, subdomains, endpoints, usernames, etc. Where available, the WorkOS API will provide these fields when fetching directory records.

### `directory`
